They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.\n\nJoining and Leaving a Unit\nAn Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.\n\nIn order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.\nAn Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase – once shots are fired or Charges are declared.\n\nAn Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.\n\nSpecial Rules\nWhen an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.\n\nIndependent Characters and Infiltrate\nAn Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.\n\nIndependent Characters and Ongoing Effects\nSometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.\n\nConversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared."

A Shattered Legions Detachment may not include any models with the Primarch or Daemon Primarch Unit Types.\nWhen you add a Shattered Legions Detachment to your army, you must select either two or three different Legions from the following and note them on your army roster:\n• Dark Angels • Emperor’s Children • Iron Warriors • White Scars • Space Wolves • Imperial Fists • Night Lords • Blood Angels • Iron Hands • World Eaters • Ultramarines • Death Guard • Thousand Sons • Sons of Horus • Word Bearers • Salamanders • Raven Guard • Alpha Legion\nEvery model in this Detachment must represent one of your selected Legions. A model ‘represents’ a Legion when it clearly displays the Legion iconography and heraldry of that Legion. If any model does not clearly display iconography or colours that obviously identify it as a member of a single specific Legion, then it represents no Legion and is not counted for determining the Majority or Minority of a unit (see page 135 ). The number of models in a unit that represent each Legion is at your discretion, but each unit on your army roster must contain models representing as many of your selected Legions as possible (e.g., a unit with two models must represent two different Legions and a unit of three or more models must contain at least one model representing each selected Legion).\nModels with the Independent Character special rule can select options (excluding Legiones Consularis upgrades) from the Armoury page of the Legion they are representing as if they had the equivalent version of the Legiones Astartes (X) special rule. For example, a model with the Independent Character special rule that is representing the Imperial Fists Legion could select options from the Armoury of the Imperial Fists pages of Liber Astartes as if they had the Legiones Astartes (Imperial Fists) special rule.

If the number is tied between two or more Legions then the controlling player can select one of the tied Legions to be the Minority.\nWhen counting models in a unit, all models are counted no matter what unit type they have – excepting only Dedicated Transports which are not considered part of the unit. Models that include multiple crew or operators as part of a single model, such as Legion Javelins, are considered to represent the Legion whose icons or colours are displayed on the main component of that model. For example, a Legion Javelin that has two crew models, one in Raven Guard colours and one in Salamanders colours, represents the Legion whose colours are on the Javelin itself, ignoring the crew.\nThe calculated Majority and Minority Legions apply until the end of that Phase, and so do not require recalculating during a Phase as units take casualties and models are removed.\n\n\nDesigner’s Note:\nCalculating Majority and Minority\nWhile you should calculate the Majority and Minority Legions in each unit at the start of each Phase, in practicality, you might find it easier to only worry about calculating which traits apply when it becomes relevant in a given Phase, such as the first time you select that unit to make attacks, or the first time that unit is targeted by an enemy unit. You may also find that if, for example, you have not selected any Legions whose traits interact with the Movement phase, then it is not necessary to calculate the Majority and Minority Legions during that Phase. Similarly, in your opponent’s Shooting phase, you may find it easier to calculate the Majority and Minority Legions the first time a unit from your army is selected as the target of a Shooting Attack, or the first time it is eligible to make a Reaction. In your opponent’s Assault phase, you may find many of your units are not Locked in Combat or eligible to be Charged (because there are no enemy units within range) and so it will not be necessary to calculate the Majority and Minority Legions for those units during that Phase. This approach will save some time during the battle, and ensure you do not spend time calculating which rules apply to a unit that will not need to use them during that Phase. This process of judgement will become easier as you fight more battles with your Shattered Legions army and become more familiar with when and how the traits for your selected Legions become active or relevant within the various Phases of a battle."

This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their Minimum Range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker always scatters a full 2D6\". If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its Minimum Range.\nNote that any Hits inflicted upon Vehicles by an Attack using the Barrage special rule are always resolved against the Vehicle’s Side Armour Value.\n\nMultiple Barrages\nIf a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows:\nThe Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the Blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as described earlier. Once the first marker is placed, roll a Scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram below). If a Hit is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker). Once all of the markers are in place, add up the number of Hits and roll To Wound for these Hits. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first Blast marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage.\n\nApocalyptic Barrage\nAn Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses the clover-shaped Apocalyptic Barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter in the same way you would for a Blast. If the marker scatters, be careful to maintain the same orientation as you move it. \n\nOnce the final position of the marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks on the weapon’s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type ‘Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage’, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds to a ‘strike’ on one of the circles on the Apocalyptic Barrage marker. For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire Apocalyptic Barrage marker."

Instead, pick one enemy model visible to the firer and place the Blast (3\") marker with its hole entirely over the base of the target model, or its hull if the target is a Vehicle. The hole at the centre of the marker must be within the weapon’s Maximum Range. You cannot place the Blast marker so that the base or hull of any friendly model is even partially under it.\n\nThe large area affected by the blast means it is going to be very hard to miss completely. Nonetheless, the shot might not land exactly where intended. Roll for the Blast marker to scatter and subtract the firer’s Ballistic Skill from the distance (if any) that it scatters, to a minimum of 0\". Note that it is possible, and absolutely fine, for a shot to scatter beyond the weapon’s Maximum or Minimum Range and line of sight. This represents the chance of ricochets, the missile blasting through cover and other random events. In these cases, Hits are worked out as normal and can hit and Wound units out of range and line of sight (or even your own units, or models locked in combat). If the shot scatters so that the hole in the centre of the marker is beyond the battlefield’s edge, the shot is a complete miss and is discarded.\n\nOnce the final position of the Blast marker has been determined, take a good look at it from above – each unit suffers one Hit for each of the models included in that unit that is fully or partially beneath the Blast marker, even if those models are not within the firer’s line of sight.\n\nOnce the number of Hits inflicted on the unit has been worked out, roll To Wound and Save as normal. Note that, unlike other attacks, Wounds inflicted by an attack with the Blast special rule can be allocated to any models in the target unit, even if they are out of sight of any models from the attacking unit.\n\nMultiple Blasts\nIf a unit is firing more than one shot with the Blast special rule, scatter each shot, one at a time, as described above and determine how many Hits are scored with each individual Blast marker. After the last shot, add up the total number of Hits scored and roll all of the To Wound rolls as normal.\n\nBlast Weapons and Re-rolls\nIf a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit and chooses to do so after firing a Blast weapon, the player must re-roll both the Scatter dice and the 2D6. Note that this applies only to models able to fully re-roll a To Hit roll, not to models that may re-roll To Hit rolls of a specific value – for example, models that can re-roll To Hit rolls of a ‘1’ cannot re-roll either the Scatter dice or 2D6 unless another rule allows them to do so.\n\nBlast Weapons and Snap Shots\nBlast weapons cannot be fired as Snap Shots.\n\nLarge Blast\nLarge Blast weapons use the 5\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n\nMassive Blast\nMassive Blast weapons use the 7\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n\nApocalyptic Blast\nApocalyptic Blast weapons use the 10\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n\nApocalyptic Mega-blast (5\"/7\"/10\")\nApocalyptic Mega-blast weapons use the Apocalyptic Blast marker. They obey the rules for Blast weapons, with the following exceptions:\n\nApocalyptic Mega-blast weapons have three Strength values and three AP values. Correspondingly, the Apocalyptic Blast marker is divided into three zones, as shown in the diagram on the next page, one for each Strength and AP value.\n\nThe Strength and AP of any Hits depends on the zone in which the target model is located. The first Strength and AP value are used for the inner zone, the second Strength and AP value are used for the middle zone, and the third Strength and AP value are used for the outer zone. Always use the best Strength and AP if a model straddles two or more zones. If a unit has models in several zones, work out the Hits inflicted for each zone separately. Note that there will be a different Wound Pool for each zone.\n\nTo determine whether a unit wounded by an Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapon is allowed a Cover Save, and when determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the Apocalyptic Blast marker, instead of from the firing model.\n\nHits from Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons made against Vehicles are always resolved against their Side Armour Value."

Place a single model from that unit anywhere on the battlefield that is at least 6\" from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain and is outside of all Deployment Zones. Do not scatter the model.\n\nIf possible, the model must be placed in a position that will allow any other models in the same unit to deploy (as follows), and may only be placed in a position that denies the remainder of the squad a place within unit coherency if no other position is available.\n\nOnce the model’s final position has been decided, the remainder of the unit may be deployed anywhere that is within unit coherency and more than 6\" from any enemy model or piece of Impassable Terrain. Any models that cannot be placed are removed as casualties.\n\nOnce this first unit has been deployed, roll a D6. On the roll of a ‘1’, the Area Denial Drop is Disordered and the opposing player may deploy each remaining unit in the Area Denial Drop anywhere within 12\" of the first unit without scattering, though no model may be within 1\" of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain. If the roll is a ‘2’ or higher, the controlling player deploys each remaining unit anywhere within 12\" of the first, though no model may be within 1\" of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain.\n\nOnce all units are deployed, any enemy units within line of sight and range may choose to make the Interceptor Reaction (see page 309 of the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook) targeting any one of the units deployed as part of the Area Denial Drop. Any units that are chosen to make the Interceptor Reaction do not expend any of the controlling player’s Reaction Allotment for the Phase, but do count as having made a Reaction (and thus cannot React again in this Phase). Note that no Reaction other than Interceptor may be made against the deployment of a unit as part of an Area Denial Drop.\n\nOnce all units from the Area Denial Drop have been deployed and any Interceptor Reactions have been resolved, the turn proceeds as normal.

That player must place a single model with the Subterranean Assault special rule that is either a Dedicated Transport or a unit of its own (this model may have a unit Embarked within) anywhere on the battlefield that is at least 1\" from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain and then scatter that model (see the Scatter rules on page 152 of the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook).\n\nIf the model’s final position is within 1\" of an enemy model, any battlefield edge or a piece of Impassable Terrain, the controlling player’s opponent may move that model to any position within 18\" that is more than 1\" from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain.\n\nIf there is no suitable position within 18\" then the model may be repositioned anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 1\" from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain.\n\nOnce this first unit has been deployed, roll a dice. On the roll of a ‘1’ the Subterranean Assault is Disordered, and the opposing player may deploy each remaining unit in the Subterranean Assault anywhere within 12\" of the first unit without scattering, though no model may be within 1\" of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain. If the roll is a ‘2’ or higher, the controlling player deploys each other unit anywhere within 12\" of the first, though no model may be within 1\" of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain. Any models Embarked on a model with the Transport Sub-type must remain Embarked and may not Disembark as part of a Subterranean Assault (but may Disembark normally during the following Movement phase).\n\nOnce all units are deployed, any enemy units with one or more models within 6\" of any unit deployed as part of the Subterranean Assault suffer D6+3 Str 6, AP 4 Hits (Wounds caused by these Hits do not cause Morale checks or Pinning tests). Once all Hits are resolved, any enemy units that are neither Pinned or Falling Back and are within line of sight may choose to make the Interceptor Reaction (see page 309 of the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook) targeting any one of the units deployed as part of the Subterranean Assault. Note that no Reaction other than Interceptor may be made against the deployment of a unit as part of a Subterranean Assault.\n\nOnce all units from the Subterranean Assault have been deployed and any Interceptor Reactions have been resolved, the turn proceeds as normal. Units that have been deployed as part of a Subterranean Assault may Move, Run or Shoot as normal. However, only units deployed aboard a model with the Transport Sub-type with the Assault Vehicle special rule may declare and resolve a Charge and Assault as normal. Other units deployed as part of a Subterranean Assault may not declare or resolve a Charge on the same turn as they are deployed."
